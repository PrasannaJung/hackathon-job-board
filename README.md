This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## targetting all bounties

one of the major problems is that we have never applied to any bounties in our past . This is actually our first project where we apply for bounties . We worked so hard on this that it is a proud moment for us to annonce that despite all hardship we were able to integrate each one in our project. and proudly say  that we are working with all our sponser. @filecoin @chainlink @valist @ polygon. 

##problems faced

- never had i ever used to do anything with api fetching and was i used to doing from docs used this time in web3.storage and found somethings which was harder for me than the standard protocol.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

- getting documentations of the project was not easy. searvhing from github and googling stuff which we couldn't figure out was one of the most diffeicult part . 

- how we overcame we went to the moralis server on there we asked in teh precise section on how to integrete these things from our app . their helpfullness helped us out

## how we overcame them 

we planned and worked for a common time of the to continue meetings on how to proceed with the project.


never made anything in nextjs had problem figuring out the file structure and thus figuring out how to do even the project makes so much problem.
